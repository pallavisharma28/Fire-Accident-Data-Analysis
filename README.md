# Grouping of California State Wildland Fire Accident Data Based on Discriminant Classification and Cluster Analysis

#Abstract: In the current study, the grouping of wildland fire accident data corresponding to state of California is performed based on #discriminant analysis and cluster analysis. Descriptive statistics of the selected variables of fire accident data is demonstrated through #Q-Q plots and normality of data is verified. Stepwise reduction technique is adopted to reduce the number of variables. Principal #component analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data. MANOVA is performed on the dimensionally reduced data to #verify the assumptions of covariance equality and classification rule is determined. Discriminant rule based classification is performed #on the data to classify them into one of the 9 causes of the fire. Cluster analysis is performed to determine the number of groups. The #accuracy of discriminant based classification is evaluated to be 36% when three variables were chosen. The Wardâ€™s method resulted in 3 #number of clusters and complete linkage resulted in 6 number of clusters.
